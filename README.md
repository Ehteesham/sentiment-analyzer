# Sentiment Analyzer Web Application

This is a Python-based web application for sentiment analysis. It uses a Flask web framework and comes with a Docker image for easy deployment. You can run the application either by using Docker or by setting up the project locally. Follow the instructions below for both approaches.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:

- **[Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)** (for running the application in a containerized environment).
- **[Python 3.12+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)** and **pip** (for running the application without Docker).
- If you choose to run the application **locally**, a basic understanding of Python and Flask is recommended.

## Method 1: Run with Docker

If you prefer to run the web application using Docker, follow these steps:

### 1. Install Docker

Make sure you have Docker installed. If not, [download and install Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

After installation, make sure Docker is running. You can check with:

```bash
docker --version
```

### 2. Log in to Docker Hub (if necessary)

You need a Docker Hub account to pull and run the image. If you don't have one, you can create an account at Docker Hub.

```bash
docker login
```
Enter your username and password when prompted.

### 3. Pull the Docker Image

```bash
docker pull ehteesham/sentimentanalyzer:latest
```
This will download the Docker image to your local machine.

### 4. Run the Docker Container

Once the image is pulled, you can run the Docker container:

```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 yourusername/sentimentanalyzer
```
This command will run the Flask application inside the container and expose it on port 5000.

### 5. Access the Application
After the container is running, open a browser and go to:
```bash
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```
You should now see the sentiment analysis web app running.


## Method 2: Run Locally (Without Docker)

If you prefer to run the project locally without Docker, follow these steps.

### 1. Clone the Project Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ehteesham/sentiment-analyzer.git
cd sentiment-analyzer
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

Itâ€™s a good practice to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies. You can do this with the following commands:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment (Windows)
venv\Scripts\activate

# Or on macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install the Required Dependencies

Install the necessary dependencies from the requirements.txt file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Download NLTK Resources (For Tokenization and Stopwords)

Some resources from NLTK are required for text processing. In your terminal, run the following commands:

```bash
python3 -m nltk.downloader punkt_tab stopwords
```
This ensures that the application can tokenize text and filter out stopwords.

### 5. Run the Flask Application

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the Flask app with:

```bash
python app.py
```

### 6. Access the Application

After the Flask app starts, you can open your browser and go to:
```bash
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```
This will open the sentiment analysis web app.
